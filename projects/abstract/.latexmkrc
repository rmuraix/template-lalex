# Project-specific latexmk settings.
# Common settings (TEXINPUTS, BIBINPUTS, out_dir) are inherited from the
# root .latexmkrc loaded via -r. Override engine settings here as needed.
#
# Default engine is LuaLaTeX (set in root .latexmkrc).
# Uncomment to switch engines:
#   $pdf_mode = 1;  # pdfLaTeX
#   $pdf_mode = 5;  # XeLaTeX
